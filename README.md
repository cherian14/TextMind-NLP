## What Makes TextMind-NLP Special?
This isn't just another code project â€“ it's your secret weapon for smarter hiring. Here's why recruiters love it:
- **Scrapes Real Job Listings**: Pulls in 500+ job descriptions from the web (ethically, of course) to match against real-world needs.
- **Smart Resume Reading**: Upload a PDF resume, and it pulls out key skills, experience, and details using easy NLP tricks.
- **Perfect Match Scoring**: Uses AI to compare resumes to jobs, giving you a simple percentage score â€“ like "85% fit" for that dream candidate.
- **Time-Saver for Teams**: No more manual checks. Process tons of resumes fast and rank them from best to worst.
- **Unique Twist**: Combines web scraping, text smarts, and math magic to give insights no basic tool can match.

Recruiters say it saves hours per day â€“ think of all the coffee breaks you'll earn!

## How It Works (Super Simple Breakdown)
1. **Gather Jobs**: The tool grabs job descriptions from sites (or uses samples for testing).
2. **Read Resumes**: Feed it a PDF, and it extracts the important bits like skills and experience.
3. **Match and Score**: AI compares everything and spits out scores â€“ high numbers mean great fits!
4. **See Results**: Get a list like "Software Engineer Job: 92% Match" right in your console.

It's like having an AI assistant that does the boring work, so you focus on interviews.

## Quick Setup (Even If You're Not a Tech Pro)
1. **Clone the Project**: Grab it from GitHub with `git clone https://github.com/cherian14/TextMind-NLP.git`.
2. **Install Tools**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (needs Python 3+).
3. **Extra Steps**:
   - For language smarts: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.
   - For text helpers: The code grabs what it needs automatically.
4. **Ready to Go!** No fancy servers needed â€“ runs on your laptop.

## How to Use It (Step-by-Step)
Fire it up from your command line:
```
python resume_parser.py your_resume.pdf https://job-site.com/search 10 false
```
- `your_resume.pdf`: Path to the resume file.
- `https://job-site.com/search`: Where to find jobs (or skip for samples).
- `10`: How many pages to check (aim for 500+ jobs!).
- `false`: Turn off simulation for real scraping.

Watch it work its magic and print matches like:
```
Top Matches:
- Software Engineer: 92% Fit
- Data Scientist: 78% Fit
```
Pro Tip: Save results to a CSV for easy sharing with your team.
